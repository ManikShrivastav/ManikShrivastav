**👽 Welcome to Alien’s Code - Where Limits Don’t Exist**


I’m Alien, the coder who lives in the other dimension of development. I don’t follow trends; I build what should be built. If it doesn’t break boundaries, I’m not interested.


💻 Languages I Mess With:

C – For when I want to get close to the hardware

Arduino – Because why not control real-world stuff with code?

PHP – Server-side wizardry (no, I don’t need your frameworks)

Assembly – For when I need to be that low-level

Java – Building things that actually scale



🔥 Projects That’ll Make You Go “WTF”:

Pariksha Plugin – Live Examination directly through the website.

EOE – Also known as Echoes of Engineers, share your feelings, confessions, and anger anonymously.

NepalOS – The Operating System which will definitely beat all the data collecting OS Companies.👽 You know who 💀


🚀 Why Am I Here?

I build crazy shit that works. No fluff, just code that gets results. If you need some bizarre challenge solved, I’m your alien.
