I’m **Alien**, the coder who lives in the other dimension of development. I don’t follow trends; I build what should be built. If it doesn’t break boundaries, I’m not interested.




💻 Languages I Mess With:

**C** – For when I want to get close to the hardware

**Arduino** – Because why not control real-world stuff with code?

**PHP** – Server-side wizardry (no, I don’t need your frameworks)

**Assembly** – For when I need to be that low-level

**Java** – Building things that actually scale





**🔥 Projects That’ll Make You Go “WTF”:**

**Pariksha Plugin** – Live Examination directly through the website.

**EOE** – Also known as Echoes of Engineers, share your feelings, confessions, and anger anonymously.

**NepalOS** – The Operating System which will definitely beat all the data collecting OS Companies.👽 You know who 💀




**🚀 Why Am I Here?**

I build crazy shit that works. No fluff, just code that gets results. If you need some bizarre challenge solved, I’m your alien.
